Hi, Iâ€™m @laazik .

I used to:
- Deal with data, SMS, VAS etc. in Telia ðŸ“±
- Do networking and voice/video in MS/Skype ðŸ“ž
- Make mobile payments in Fortumo ðŸ¤‘
- Be accountable for SMS engineering in Twilio ðŸ“©

Which is quite a lot of stuff. Included coding, mainly in backend, building engineering teams etc. 

Currently I am a founder of Vegtable Tech. Company building vertical farming technology and automation. ðŸŒ±

I do major languages and minor languages (IEC 61131 anyone?). I also know a thing or two about very high scale loosely coupled systems in cloud, with all the bits and pieces.
